   This project implements the Simplex Algorithm, a popular method used for solving Linear Programming Problems (LPP). It is written in Python and    
   provides a simple and efficient way to solve LPPs.  

## About the Simplex Algorithm                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
   The Simplex Algorithm is a mathematical method for solving optimization problems. In the context of Linear Programming Problems (LPP), it is use   
   to find the best outcome in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships.                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
   The algorithm solves LPPs by constructing a feasible solution at a vertex of the polytope and then walking along a path on the edges of the        
   polytope to vertices with non-decreasing values of the objective function until an optimum is reached.
